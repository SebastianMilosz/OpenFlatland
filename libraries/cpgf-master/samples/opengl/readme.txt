A sample for using OpenGL in Lua and Google V8 Javascript

The build script is included in the main project in folder "build".

The sample requires OpenGL and GLUT, and at least Lua or Google V8 library.

The sample will display a colorful rotating 3D cube, and a text string is around the cube.
Press arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the cube a little bit.
All the GL/GLUT related code is written in Lua, Javascript, or Python.
