Sample code for cpgf Irrlicht script binding

Issues:
23.smeshhandling -- the default map size is 10*10, please keep it no larger than 50*50, otherwise, it's very very slow to generate the map.

Run the sample:
All scripts assume the resources are in folder ../../media, exactly same as how the C++ version does.
So to run it, we'd better go to the sub foder in irrlicht/bin, such as irrlicht/bin/Win32-VisualStudio, and execute the sample program there.

Enjoy it!
