libsigc++ -- The Typesafe Callback Framework for C++


General information:

   libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard C++. It
   allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to any
   callback function, either global or a member function, regardless of
   whether it is static or virtual.

   libsigc++ is used by gtkmm to wrap the GTK+ signal system. It does not
   depend on GTK+ or gtkmm.

   Further information is available on the libsigc++ project home page:
   http://libsigc.sourceforge.net/
